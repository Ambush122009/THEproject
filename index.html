                    While the anime industry's explosion suggests that 2020s wealth could foster genuine community and creative opportunity, the decade's dominant financial forces (from crypto speculation to billionaire vanity projects) reveal that like Gatsby's parties masking moral decay, extreme prosperity still coexists with devastating inequality. A century later, money rarely buys meaning, only distraction from the emptiness it creates.

                <div class="thesis-context">
                    As you explore this museum, you'll encounter seven artifacts that document the complex relationship between wealth and happiness in the 2020s. The first exhibit challenges the cynical view, showing how cultural industries created authentic value. But the remaining artifacts reveal darker patterns: technologies that promised democratized wealth, vanity projects that ignored human suffering, and systemic forces that widened the gap between rich and poor. Together, these artifacts answer Gatsby's central question about whether money can buy happiness—and the 2020s give us a nuanced, ultimately tragic answer.

                    <p class="artifact-description">
                        The anime industry's transformation in the 2020s stands apart from other wealth stories of the decade. Here, money actually created something meaningful. When the pandemic forced everyone into isolation, anime didn't just generate profits. It built genuine communities across the globe. Demon Slayer: Mugen Train became the highest-grossing film of 2020 worldwide, earning over $500 million. But unlike crypto speculation or NFT schemes, people got something real in return. They got stories that resonated across cultures and languages. Sony's $1.2 billion purchase of Crunchyroll in 2021 wasn't just corporate consolidation. It legitimized a medium that had been dismissed as niche for decades, opening doors for creators worldwide.

                    <p class="artifact-description" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        Anime conventions exploded into massive gatherings where fans found belonging, small businesses thrived, and voice actors, animators, and content creators built careers doing work they loved. The global market reaching over $30 billion by 2025 represented something unusual for the 2020s. This was wealth that didn't come at someone else's expense. Unlike Gatsby throwing parties to fill a void, anime wealth emerged from genuine passion meeting global appetite. Creators earned money by bringing people together rather than by exploiting their loneliness. This suggested that perhaps wealth could build community instead of destroying it.

                    <p class="artifact-description">
                        If anime showed wealth building community, AI revealed its opposite. Fortunes concentrated in the hands of a few while entire professions faced extinction. ChatGPT reached 100 million users faster than any app in history, and OpenAI's valuation ballooned to $157 billion by 2025. The speed was unprecedented, the wealth astronomical, and the human cost largely ignored. Voice actors who spent decades mastering their craft watched AI tools learn to mimic them in hours. Artists saw their styles replicated without permission or compensation. Writers discovered their job descriptions now included "AI oversight" rather than actual creation.

                    <p class="artifact-description" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        Tools like Midjourney generated billions in value, but that value flowed upward to tech CEOs, not to the artists whose work trained the algorithms. New roles emerged like prompt engineers, AI ethicists, and AI trainers. But they couldn't replace the traditional artists, writers, and customer service workers whose jobs simply disappeared. Tom Buchanan never had to work for his inheritance. AI billionaires never had to compensate the labor that built their empires. The technology promised to democratize creativity, but instead it revealed an uncomfortable truth. Ownership matters more than contribution, and those who own the tools will always profit more than those who actually create.

Beeple's digital art fetched $69 million. For a moment, it seemed like anyone could get rich by understanding blockchain before their neighbors did. The peak market cap reached $3 trillion, more money than most people could conceptualize. All built on what, exactly? Code? Belief? Speculation?

                        By 2022, the answer became brutally clear. Nothing solid. The market crashed, destroying $2 trillion in value. Lives ruined by speculation and scams became so common they stopped making headlines. The pattern repeated itself with mechanical precision. Early adopters cashed out wealthy, ordinary Americans bought at the peak, and the dream collapsed just as they'd mortgaged everything on it. Gatsby built his fortune on bootlegging, at least dealing in physical goods that people wanted. Crypto promised wealth without sources, without regulation, without anything real backing it except collective delusion. Those who got out early called themselves visionaries. Those who didn't called themselves fools. Neither was wrong.

                    <p class="artifact-description">
                        Jeff Bezos spent eleven minutes in space. The cost? Roughly $5.5 billion in development. That's enough to give each of his 1.3 million employees a $4,000 bonus, or to lift thousands of children out of poverty in a country where 16.9% of kids lived below the poverty line in 2024. Instead, he got eleven minutes of weightlessness and a cowboy hat. Elon Musk and Richard Branson joined the race, each spending billions on vanity projects while their employees fought for bathroom breaks and union rights.

                        The combined cost exceeded $10 billion. Money that could have transformed communities, funded education, addressed climate change. But transforming communities doesn't get you on magazine covers. Tom and Daisy Buchanan smashed up things and people, then retreated into their money. These billionaires didn't even pretend to care about the wreckage. They literally left the planet while the problems their wealth created continued to fester on the ground. The 2020s gave us the most honest display of extreme wealth in American history. When you have enough money, you don't fix Earth's problems. You escape them entirely, leaving everyone else to suffocate in what remains.

                        MrBeast earned $54 million in 2021. Thousands of teenagers became millionaires on TikTok. The influencer economy exploded to $21 billion by 2023, and suddenly everyone with a phone thought they could be next. This was the promise. Monetize your life, be authentic, get rich. The reality? Ninety-nine percent of aspiring influencers earn less than minimum wage. They film their lives, edit their personalities, perform happiness for algorithms that care only about engagement metrics.

                        The successful few earning over $20 million annually make it look effortless, which is the cruelest part. They're not lucky, they insist. They're just authentic. They just worked hard. They just happened to post the right video at the right time, figured out the algorithm, built their brand. And millions believe them, keep filming, keep posting, keep hoping that the next video will be the one that changes everything. Gatsby threw parties hoping one night Daisy would walk through the door. Modern kids post videos hoping one will go viral. Both are chasing lights that recede the moment you reach for them. The difference is Gatsby at least got parties. Most influencers get nothing but time wasted and lives unlived while performing for strangers who scroll past without remembering their names.

That'll be $38,000 in debt, on average, with a 20-year repayment plan. Student loan debt reached $1.7 trillion by 2024, shackling an entire generation before they'd even started their careers. College costs increased 180% since 1980. Wages stayed flat. The math didn't work, but what choice did people have?

                        Don't go to college, watch doors close before you even approach them. Go to college, spend two decades paying for the privilege. The promise was simple. Education leads to prosperity. The reality was crueler. Education leads to debt, and maybe, if you're lucky and choose the right major and graduate in the right economy and don't face any unexpected setbacks, that debt eventually leads to stability. Not wealth. Not freedom. Just stability, if you're fortunate. The American Dream once meant you could work your way up from nothing. Now it means you mortgage your future for a chance to not fall further behind. That's not a dream. That's a ransom note.

During the pandemic, while 60% of Americans lived paycheck to paycheck, billionaire wealth increased by 70%. CEOs earned 399 times what their average workers made. Not because they worked 399 times harder, but because the system was designed to concentrate wealth at the top. The middle class shrunk annually since 1971, each year losing more ground, more stability, more hope.

                        These aren't just statistics. They're the architecture of two Americas that barely recognize each other's existence. One America launches vanity rockets, buys yachts for their yachts, plays with billions while calling it investment. The other America chooses between rent and healthcare, works multiple jobs and still falls behind, watches their children inherit less opportunity than they had. Fitzgerald wrote about the valley of ashes visible from Tom Buchanan's mansion, but at least the Buchanans could see the suffering their wealth ignored. Modern inequality is more insidious. Algorithms and gated communities and class segregation ensure the rich never have to witness what their wealth costs. The 2020s didn't just repeat the inequality of the 1920s. We perfected it, automated it, made it invisible to those who benefit most.

                The anime industry proved it was possible. Wealth could build genuine community, create opportunities, bring people together across borders. For a moment, it seemed like maybe the 2020s would write a different story than the 1920s, that money could be a force for connection rather than corruption. But one exception doesn't make a rule. The dominant forces of the decade (crypto speculation that destroyed lives, AI that displaced workers, billionaires who literally fled Earth rather than address its problems, influencer culture that sold false dreams, student debt that trapped entire generations, and inequality that reached levels unseen in a century) all told the same old story Fitzgerald warned us about. Money brought rockets and NFTs and viral fame, but not happiness. Not meaning. Not equity.

                A hundred years after Gatsby, we're still chasing the same illusion. Anime showed us what wealth could be. A tool for building community and supporting creativity. But crypto, AI, space races, influencer culture, student debt, and systemic inequality showed us what wealth usually is. A corrupting force that concentrates at the top while everyone else fights for scraps. The green light still glows across the water, promising that the next innovation, the next investment, the next viral post will finally deliver the dream. The 2020s taught us what the 1920s should have. Technology changes, fortunes rise and fall, but human nature and the corruption of extreme wealth remain constant. We're living through a new Roaring '20s, and we already know how this story ends.
