                    While the anime industry's explosion suggests that 2020s wealth could result in a genuine community and creative opportunity, this decade's financial events reveal that like Gatsby's parties hiding moral decay, extreme prosperity hides gross inequality. A century later, money rarely buys meaning, only gives us a distraction from the emptiness it creates.

                <div class="thesis-context">
                 Through the wonderful museum, you'll see seven artifacts that document the relationship between wealth and happiness in the 2020s. The first exhibit challenges the view, showing how cultural industries created authentic value. But the remaining artifacts plunge into a valley and reveal real patterns: technologies that promised but couldn't deliver wealth, waste projects that ignored human suffering, and forces that widened the gap between rich and poor. Together, these handpicked by experts and wonderful artifacts answer Gatsby's central question about whether money can buy happiness. The 2020s give us a nuanced, and ultimately tragic answer.

                    <p class="artifact-description">
                        The anime industry's transformation in the 2020s is counteractive from other wealth stories of the decade. In this case, money actually created something meaningful. When the pandemic forced everyone into their homes, anime built communities to connect the people. Demon Slayer: Mugen Train was the highest-grossing film of 2020, and it earned over $500 million. Unlike crypto or NFT, people got something real in return. They were able to get stories that really resonated with the people in every country. The economy grew so much that Sony made a $1.2 billion purchase of Crunchyroll in 2021. It legitimized a social medium that had been looked down on and niche for years, leading to the creation opportunities for creators worldwide.

                    <p class="artifact-description" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        Anime conventions led way to massive gatherings where people found a place to belong, small businesses thrived, and voice actors, animators, and content creators built careers doing work they loved. The global market reaching over $30 billion by 2025 represented something really unusual for the 2020s. This was wealth that didn't come at someone's expense. Unlike Gatsby throwing parties to fill a void, anime wealth came from genuine passion meeting global need for entertainment. Creators got money by bringing people together instead of exploiting them, a rare trend throughout the 2020s. This sshows that perhaps wealth could just maybe build community instead of destroying it.

                    <p class="artifact-description">
                        If anime showed wealth building community, AI is the opposite side of the coin. Fortunes were densely put in the hands of a the top while entire professions faced destruction. ChatGPT got to 100 million users faster than any app ever made, and OpenAI's value literally ballooned to $157 billion by 2025. The speed was unexpected to say the least, and the wealth was jaw-dropping, but the human cost was largely ignored. Voice actors who spent decades mastering their craft couldn't do anything but watch AI tools learn to mimic them in hours. Artists saw their styles replicated without permission or compensation. Writers discovered their job descriptions now had the line "AI oversight" rather than actual creation.

                    <p class="artifact-description" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        Tools like Midjourney made billions of dollows, but that money went to CEOs, not to the artists whose work the Ai used to make its algorithms. New roles came like prompt engineers, AI ethicists, and AI trainers. But they couldn't possibly replace the artists, writers, and customer service workers whose jobs literally just disappeared. Tom Buchanan never had to work for his inheritance. The tech billionaires who made their money through Ai never had to compensate the years of labor that built their empires. The technology promised to share creativity, but instead it revealed a truth. Ownership matters more than contribution now, and those who own the tools will always profit more than those who actually create the same tools.

                        The green light glows different colors in every era. In the 2020s, it glows red, green, and blue. A single Bitcoin was worth $69,000 in 2021, creating millionaires almost instantly and reviving the oldest American dream. Sudden wealth through unclear means. NFTs sold for millions. Beeple's digital art fetched $69 million. For a moment, it seemed like anyone could get rich by understanding blockchain before others did. The peak market cap reached $3 trillion, more money than most people could understand. All built on what, exactly? Code? Belief? Speculation?

                        By 2022, the answer became as clear as day Nothing solid. The market crashed and with it brought $2 trillion in value down in flames. Lives were ruined by scams and they became so common they even stopped making headlines that they used to make. The pattern repeated with pin-point precision. Early adopters cashed out with all the money while ordinary Americans bought at the peak, and the dream collapsed with its market. Gatsby built his fortune through bootlegging, at least dealing in physical goods that people wanted and could touch. Crypto promised wealth sources, regulation, or really anything real backing it. It only provided one thing and that is a collective delusion. Those who got out early called themselves visionaries. Those who didn't called themselves fools. Neither of those were wrong.

                        Jeff Bezos spent eleven minutes in space. The cost? Roughly $5.5 billion. That's enough to give each of his 1.3 million employees a $4,000 bonus, it can also bring thousands of children out of poverty in a country where 16.9% of kids lived below the poverty line. Instead, he got eleven minutes of weightlessness and a cowboy hat. Elon Musk and Richard Branson joined too in this "race",  each spending billions on waste projects while their employees struggled with bathroom breaks and union rights.

                        The combined cost was more then $10 billion. Money that could have changed the lives of many communities, funded education in the millions, and addressed even climate change. But doing those probably doesn't get you on magazine covers. Tom and Daisy Buchanan smashed up things and people, then they retreated to their money. These billionaires don't even pretend to care about the wreckage that they are creating. They left the planet while the problems their wealth created continued to destroy people on the ground. The 2020s gave us the most honest show of extreme wealth in American history. When you have enough money, you don't fix Earth's problems. You leave them entirely, leaving the less fortunate to be poisoned by whatever remains.

                        MrBeast got around $54 million in 2021 and many teenagers became millionaires. The influencer economy went all the way to $21 billion by 2023, and suddenly anyone with a phone and some WiFi thought they could be the next big one. They just had to monetize your life, be authentic, and simpley get rich. But that wasn't what really happened. Ninety-nine percent of these new "influencers" earn less than minimum wage. They filmed their lives, edited their personalities, and performed happiness for basically nothing.

                        The successful few that got more then $20 million annually make it look so simple, which is the cruelest part. They're just authentic. They just worked hard. They just happened to post the right video when the trend was trending. They just figured out the algorithm. They built their brand. And millions foolishly believe them. Both Gatsby and the new wave if Influencers are chasing lights that get further the moment you reach for them. The difference is Gatsby at least got parties. Most influencers recieve nothing but time wasted and lives wasted while performing for strangers who scroll past in the first 2 seconds.

Want a shot at a humble and genuine middle-class stability? That'll be $38,000 in debt, on average, with a 20-year repayment plan. Student loan debt got to around $1.7 trillion by 2024, shackling an entire generation before they'd even get out of their cages. College costs increased 180% since 1980.

                        Don't go to college and watch doors close before you even step near them. Go to college, spend two decades paying for the "privilege". The promise was simple. Education lead to prosperity. The reality was much crueler. Education lead to debt, and just maybe, if you're lucky and choose the right major and graduate in the correct economy and don't face any unexpected setbacks, that debt eventually leads to stability. Not wealth. Not freedom. Just humble and simple stability, if you're fortunate. The American Dream once meant you could work your way up from nothing. Now it means you putting your future in the hands of others for a chance to not fall even further behind.                     </p>

The bottom 50% held just a horrifying  2%. During the pandemic, while 60% of Americans lived paycheck to paycheck, billionaire wealth got increased by 70%. CEOs earned an astonishing 399 times what their average workers made. Not because they worked 399 times harder, but because the system was designed to put wealth at the top.

                        These aren't just statistics. They're the base of two Americas that barely even see each other's existence. One America launches wasteful rockets, buys yachts for their yachts, plays with billions and calls it investment. The other America chooses between rent and healthcare. Fitzgerald wrote about the valley of ashes visible from Tom Buchanan's mansion, but at least the Buchanans could see the suffering that their wealth ignored. Modern inequality is more evil. Algorithms and gated communities and class segregation really make sure the rich never have to witness what their wealth costs the rest of the world. The 2020s didn't just repeat the inequality that was there in 1920s. We fined it, automated it, and gave it an excuse for the rich to turn a blind eye.

                The anime industry proved it was possible. Wealth can create a happy world, nice opportunities for everyone, and even bring people together across borders. It even seemed like the 2020s isn't a repeat of the 1920s. But, as chemistry taught us, one exception doesn't make a rule. The main events of the decade all told the same old story Fitzgerald tried warned us about. Money was able to buy the top class rockets and NFTs and viral fame, but not happiness.

                A hundred years after Gatsby, we're still chasing the same illusion, it just has a different mask. Anime showed us what wealth could be. A tool for building community and supporting creativity. But crypto, AI, space races, influencer culture, student debt, and systemic inequality showed us what wealth usually is. A crippling force that concentrates at the top while everyone else fights for literal scraps. Alas, technology changes, fortunes rise and fall, but human nature and the corruption of extreme wealth remain the same. We're living through a new Roaring '20s, and we already know how this story will end.
