                        The anime industry really went off in the 2020. This was due to the boredom that came with home arrest during covid, turning the niche community into a multi-billion dollar global economy. For example, Demon Slayer: Mugen Train was the highest-grossing film of 2020 worldwide,  which earned the movie and Ufoltable(the studio) over $500 million. Streaming platforms like Crunchyroll sold to Sony for preposterously large amounts of money like $1.2 billion in 2021. All the while, anime conventions became massive gatherings fueling local passon and small businesses related to this industry.

                        Like Gatsby's green light, the influencer lifestyle represents the unattainable dream for millions. Kids chase viral fame while algorithms exploit their content for their own selfish profit. This artifact shows how wealth in the 2020s is performative. You only as rich as your last posts shows.

                    <p class="artifact-description">
                        Student loan debt reached $1.7 trillion by 2024, shackling an entire generation. College costs increased 180% since 1980 while wages stayed practically the same. The promise that education leads to wealth became a cruel joke. The same education that promises us jobs and houses right out of college now gives us layers of debt and a more selective job market then ever before.

                        This artifact reveals how wealth in the 2020s is more and more gatekept. The American Dream now needs one to take crushing debt for a chance, not even a garuntee, at stability. Unlike Gatsby's self-made (little illegal) fortune, the next generation of the workforce must choose between education and financial freedom.

                        By 2024, the top 1% of Americans held 32% of the nation's wealth, while the bottom 50% held just 2%. Billionaire wealth increased by 70% during the pandemic while 60% of Americans lived paycheck to paycheck. The gap between rich and poor reached levels that were not seen since the 1920s. Which was right before the Great Depression.

                        This final artifact answers the most essential question most directly: wealth in the 2020s is not a way to happiness but a corrupting force that divides America in to shards. Like the moral emptiness of the Buchanans' mansion, extreme wealth exists right next door to poverty, blind to the suffering it causes. The 2020s taught us that money can't buy meaning, community, or equity...but it can buy rockets, NFTs, and temporary distraction from these truths.

            <h2>Gatsby's Question, Our Answer</h2>
            <div class="conclusion-text">
                The 2020s answered Fitzgerald's century-old question about wealth with clarity. Money didn't bring happiness. it brought rockets for billionaires and debt for students. It created AI fortunes while destroying the regular workers. But it also turned culture into commodity, whether through anime streaming or gatherings making their skills open to a global stage, providing creators with new ways to reaching fans worldwide. But, the green light Gatsby chased ultimately has now become our phone screens, promising wealth and fulfillment while delivering only pain and inequality.

                A hundred years after Gatsby, we're still chasing the same illusion: that wealth equals worth, that money can fill the voids in our lives, that the next big thing will finally deliver the American Dream. The 2020s showed us that technology changes, but human nature and the corruption of extreme wealth remains constant.
